# checkmk NUT Plugin

[**_Network UPS Tools (NUT)_**](https://networkupstools.org/) _Plugin_ for [**_checkmk 2.0_**](https://checkmk.com/).

Thanks to [@minodudd](https://github.com/minodudd), [@gurubert](https://github.com/gurubert) and [@danimart1991](https://github.com/danimart1991) for their previous work on this _Plugin_.

## Installation

This _plugin_ has to be installed separately in each of the parts that form a _checkmk_ system.

First, clone or download the repository. Then...

### Agent

First, if not yet done, you need to install the check_mk_agent on your machine. The package for this you can find on your checkmk server.
(Men√º Setup, Sections Agents, Linux)

Then we need to install the dependencies:

```bash
$ sudo apt install nut-client
```

Then, copy the file `/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins/nut` to the same path where the agent is installed, and give **0775** permissions:
 
```bash
$ sudo chmod 775 /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins/nut
```

You could restart the agent with the following commands. If the installation was successful, you should see the _NUT_ info at the end of the output.

```bash
$ systemctl restart check_mk.socket
$ check_mk_agent
...
<<<nut>>>
serverroom_ups battery.charge: 100
serverroom_ups battery.voltage: 13.60
serverroom_ups battery.voltage.high: 13.00
serverroom_ups battery.voltage.low: 10.40
serverroom_ups battery.voltage.nominal: 12.0
serverroom_ups device.type: ups
...
```

### Client (Raw)

Copy the file `/local/lib/check_mk/base/plugins/agent_based/nut.py` to the same path in the _Raw Client_ of _checkmk_ and give **0775** permissions:
(full installation path: /opt/omd/sites/<yoursitename>/local/...)

```bash
$ sudo chmod 775 /local/lib/check_mk/base/plugins/agent_based/nut.py
```

> If you are using the **_Docker_** _checkmk_ image, surely you need to copy the file to the path `/cmk/local/lib/python3/cmk/base/plugins/agent_based/nut.py` inside the container.

Copy the file `/local/share/check_mk/web/plugins/wato/nut_parameters.py` to the same path in the _Raw Client_ of _checkmk_ and give **0775** permissions:

```bash
$ sudo chmod 775 /local/share/check_mk/web/plugins/wato/nut_parameters.py
```

Copy the file `/local/share/check_mk/web/plugins/metrics/nut_metrics.py` to the same path in the _Raw Client_ of _checkmk_ and give **0775** permissions:

```bash
$ sudo chmod 775 /local/share/check_mk/web/plugins/metrics/nut_metrics.py
```

Restart the client/container, and then go to the host where _NUT_ and the _Agent Plugin_ are installed and discover new services with a **_Full Service Scan_**.

## Development

For development, you could modify any of the files that where installed and then restart the _agent_ or the _client_ to test the changes.

Indeed, you could execute this command to discover new services (filtered by _nut_) in the _client_:

```bash
OMD[cmk]:~$ cmk --detect-plugins=nut -vI <HOST>
```

Or, execute this command to obtain the _nut plugin checks_ in the _client_:

```bash
OMD[cmk]:~$ cmk --plugins=nut -v --check nserver
```

> If you are using the **_Docker_** _checkmk_ image, you need to execute the command `omd su cmk` before this commands inside the container.

## Configuration

In checkmk WebClient, click on **Setup** and choose **General - Rule search** from menu. Search for rule **_nut_**.

There you con configure a rule for following warnings / critical alarms: 
- _Battery voltage_
- _Input voltage low_
- _Input voltage high_
- _Charge_
- _Runtime_
- _Load_

All those parameters have default values, you can find them in **_nut.py_** at the end.

If you want different rules for different UPS, you can do it using host tags, for example.
